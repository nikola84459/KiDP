Description:

These are tasks from the course on Concurrent and Distributed Programming. These tasks focus on solving the critical section problem in the Java programming language.

Some of the solutions to the critical section problem presented in these tasks include:

Using Java monitors and synchronized blocks

Using a single variable "moze"

Using two variables "moze"

Using Deker's algorithm

Using Peterson's algorithm

Using Peterson's algorithm for N processes

Using the Bakery algorithm

Using the Exchange algorithm

Using the TAS algorithm

Using the modified TAS algorithm

Using Java Semaphores
